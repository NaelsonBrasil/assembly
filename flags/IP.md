The address of the current instruction is kept in the Instruction Pointer (IP) register, which is sometimes called the Program Counter (PC). After the instruction is fetched from memory, the IP/PC is incremented by the length of the current instruction (to point to the next instruction).

Instruction pointer is a register that holds the memory address of the instruction to be executed next.
