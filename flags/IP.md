The address of the current instruction is kept in the Instruction Pointer (IP) register, which is sometimes called the Program Counter (PC). After the instruction is fetched from memory, the IP/PC is incremented by the length of the current instruction (to point to the next instruction).

``` 

1 Instruction pointer is a register that holds the memory address of the instruction to be executed next. 
2 The CPU is hard-wired to read the instruction pointer and execute the instruction at that particular address.
After an instruction is executed by the CPU, the instruction pointer is automatically incremented to point to the next instruction in a program. 
Loops and other branching constructs change the control flow by changing the instruction pointer.
