- Registers are independent data storage devices so it doesn't really matter in which you store your data unless a function or an instruction requires you to do so.
- In this case, it's required by the Linux system call that the data is stored in a specific register. In other cases, these rules are to be treated more like good practices: you should follow them, but you don't necessarily have to if nothing requires it.
