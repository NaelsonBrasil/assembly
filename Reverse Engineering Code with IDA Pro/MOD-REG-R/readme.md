No. It's more complicated, as you can see on sandpile.org/x86/opc_rm

d8 = 11 011 000
     11         = both operands are registers
        011     = the 'r' operand is ebx
            000 = the 'rm' operand is eax
mov r32, imm32 works differently, the destination register is the low 3 bits of the opcode, here 000 so eax. In the manual, that type of encoding is written as a + sign after the opcode, as in B8+rd id.

This is all explained in the manual, of course.

0xc0 = Operands

Operands
An x86 instruction can have zero to three operands. Operands are separated by commas (,) (ASCII 0x2C). For instructions with two operands, the first (lefthand) operand is the source operand, and the second (righthand) operand is the destination operand (that is, source->destination).

Note â€“
The Intel assembler uses the opposite order (destination<-source) for operands.

Operands can be immediate (that is, constant expressions that evaluate to an inline value), register (a value in the processor number registers), or memory (a value stored in memory). An indirect operand contains the address of the actual operand value. Indirect operands are specified by prefixing the operand with an asterisk (*) (ASCII 0x2A). Only jump and call instructions can use indirect operands.
